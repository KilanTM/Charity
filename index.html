    <p class="description">
      Some teens and people just don't have the ability to embrace the world due
      to certain circumstances and unfortunate situations like illnesses and
      losses of limbs or simply being brought into life poor. By the time
      they're older they will be unfamiliar with the world and not know how big
      and interesting it really is! The Forest, Shore, Ocean, Mountians, ect.

      Donate for the ones who have never been out and about before and are
      potentially to old to enjoy with the world they live in for a chance to
      embrace it!
